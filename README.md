# silverstripe-webp-images
This SilverStripe module generates webp images from resized jpeg and png images.

## Requirements
* See `composer.json` requirements
* GD with webp support

## Installation
* `composer require wedevelopnl/silverstripe-webp-images`

Next, you'll need to run a `dev/build` (or at least `flush`) to allow access to files with the `.webp` extension from the `.htaccess` in your `assets` directory.

## Known issues
### Using `$Image.DisableWebP` in a template
Putting `$Image.DisableWebP` in a template will not work, this somehow calls getUrl twice, properly disabling the webp URL generation on the first run, but actually outputting the second run after which the disabled flag will have been removed. A workaround for this is to use `<img $Image.DisableWebP.AttributesHTML />`

## Development and contribution
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
See read our [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document for more information.

### Getting started
We advise to use [Docker](https://docker.com)/[Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for development.\
We also included a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to simplify some commands

Our development container contains some built-in tools like `PHPCSFixer`.

#### Getting development container up
`make build` to build the Docker container and then run detached.\
If you want to only get the container up, you can simply type `make up`.

You can SSH into the container using `make sh`.

#### All make commands
You can run `make help` to get a list with all available `make` commands.
